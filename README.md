## Ride Sharing Data Results

The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types are noted:

There are near 5X as many Urban Total Drivers than Suburban Drivers and 40X more than Rural Drivers. There are a little more than 2.5X as many Urban Total Rides than Suburban Rides and 4.5X more than Rural Rides. There are near 2X as many Urban Total Fares than Suburban Fares and 7X more than Rural Fares.

Urban Drivers are saturated in that segment. Urban Drivers make for 80% of the Total Drivers across all City Types, but they account for a lesser proportion of Total Rides or earn less Average total Fares as compared to the Suburban and Rural Drivers.  

Interestingly, the data in both Suburban and Rural segments are skewed negatively. The Rural data is widely dispersed. The Urban data is symmetric. 
The Urban mean Average Fare does not fall outside the Suburban and Rural standard deviation spread, but it does fall below the Suburban and Rural mean and median.
NOTE:  the box and whisker images and the summary statistics by city type for Ride Fare data (Urban/Suburban/Rural) above.

During the first trimester of 2019, the Total Fares by City Type line chart[see below] suggests that the Suburban fares are rather consistent in this time of year with a couple spikes. The Urban fares show a bit of volatility in the month of March. The Rural fares show positive modest volatility in Ride fare data throughout the first trimester.

## Summary Recommendations
After review of the analysis, three recommendations are offered to address disparities among the city types:

1) Pyber should pursue growth opportunities in the Suburban and Rural segments.  
2) Pyber should reduce the number of Urban Drivers and/or redirect their Driver resources to the Suburban and Rural segment to increase ridership and revenues.
3) Pyber should execute a marketing campaign to increase the volume of ride-share trips in the Rural segment.
